# fibevennumber
program to calculate Fibonacci Sum of even numbers
unfortunately PHP was not able to handle the size of the number so had to do the code in C# and it was able to handle the large number better.
the idea was to come up with the fibonacci sequence and then test if the result was even if this condition is true add to a viriable
to come up with a sum.
